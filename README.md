# Maps with Graphs

## Project Summary 

This project explores 3 graphs (Breadth First Search, Dijkstra, and A*) using the Google Maps API. Users will be able to see how each algorithm behaves when trying to find the shortest path for the same start and end points. 

## Pre-requisites

* Java SDK v8

* Eclipse

**Note:** GMapsFx is not compatible with IntelliJ. So it won't work!

## Tools Used

* [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)

* GMapsFx

* JavaFX

* [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/)

## Instructions 

Open Eclipse and choose **"Open Projects from File System..."**. Once the project is imported, go to src folder and open application package. Choose MappApp.java and click "run".
