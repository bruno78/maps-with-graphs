## Graphs

_...in progress._

This project explore graphs using Google Maps API

### Week 2

1. Implemented **Degree Sequence** which is an ordered list containing the degrees of each of the vertices in a graph, in non-increasing sorted order (with repetitions). The degree sequence of a graph is an invariant of the graph and can be used to distinguish between two graphs and to analyze graph properties.
