<p align="center"><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/bruno78/maps-with-graphs/43327738/screenshots/maps-with-graphs-600px.gif"></p>

## Project Summary 

This project demonstrates how each of 3 graph algorithms work ([Breadth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search), [Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm), and [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)), using Google Maps API. Users can select each algorithm separately to compare how each behaves when trying to find the shortest path from the same start point to the same end point. 

## Pre-requisites

* Java SDK v8

* Eclipse

**Note:** GMapsFx is not compatible with IntelliJ. So it won't work!

## Tools Used

* [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)

* GMapsFx

* JavaFX

* [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/)

## Instructions 

Open Eclipse and choose **"Open Projects from File System..."**. Once the project is imported, go to src folder and open application package. Choose MappApp.java and click "run".
